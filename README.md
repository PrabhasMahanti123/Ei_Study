# Design Pattern and Smart Home System

This project demonstrates six different software design patterns with real-world use cases. It covers Behavioral, Creational, and Structural design patterns, each implemented with clear and practical examples. These patterns promote better software design, improve code maintainability, and adhere to SOLID principles.

Patterns Implemented:
1) Behavioral Design Patterns:
Observer Pattern: A weather monitoring system where multiple devices are notified of temperature changes.
Command Pattern: A file system where commands like opening and saving files are handled dynamically.

2) Creational Design Patterns:
Singleton Pattern: A database connection manager that ensures only one instance of a connection exists.
Factory Pattern: A document generation system that creates different types of documents (PDF, Word, Excel) based on user input.

3) Structural Design Patterns:
Adapter Pattern: A payment gateway adapter that integrates multiple payment providers (e.g., PayPal, Stripe) into a common interface.
Composite Pattern: A file system where files and directories are treated uniformly, allowing complex structures to be represented hierarchically.
